## Description of our Web App
ScreenWise is a web application that allows users to keep track of their screen time on a daily. Pair this with social aspects of having friends and a leaderboard! ScreenWise is here to help people reduce their screen time in a fun way with a community.

# Tools (MERN STACK)

    - Zustand (State Management)
    - Axios (API Calls)
    - React Router (Page Routing)

### Backend

- Node JS and Express
    - Node JS as my run time environment and Express to route my backend creating the API endpoints

# Challenges
Since this was my first full stack app, the challenge came from learning basic backend functions and how to display the data to the frontend of the application. I learned a lot, from how to use MongoDB to setting up my first API endpoints.
